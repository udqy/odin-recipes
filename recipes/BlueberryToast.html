    <ul>
        <li>6 slices day-old bread, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, cut into 1 inch cubes</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh blueberries</li>
        <li>6 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 Cup Milk</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tablespoons and 1/2 teaspoon maple syrup</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>Blueberry Sauce</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh blueberries</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><strong>Directions:</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare casserole: Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 1/2 of the bread cubes in the dish and top with cream cheese cubes. Sprinkle blueberries over the cream cheese, then top with remaining bread cubes.</li>
        <li>Whisk eggs, milk, vanilla extract, and syrup together in a large bowl until well-combined; pour over the bread cubes. Cover and refrigerate overnight.</li>
        <li>Remove casserole from the refrigerator about 30 minutes before baking. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bake casserole in the preheated oven, covered, for 30 minutes. Uncover, and continue baking until center is firm and surface is lightly browned, about 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, prepare blueberry sauce: Mix sugar, water, and cornstarch together in a medium saucepan; bring to a boil and cook, stirring constantly, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in blueberries, reduce heat to low, and simmer until all the blueberries burst, about 10 minutes. Stir in butter.</li>
        <li>Serve portions of casserole on plates and pour warm syrup over top.</li>
    </ol>
